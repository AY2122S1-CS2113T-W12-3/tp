# SLAM User Guide
Welcome to **SLAM**! **SLAM** is a desktop application for student group leaders in NUS to manage their group events, tasks, members and various activities. This application allows you to effectively plan and manage the organisation of events by allowing users to create and add such events to their schedule. Leading up to the actual date and time of the event, committee heads can add tasks (e.g. meetings, purchase of logistics) to complete under each event to keep track of progress. Group members can also be added and assigned to these tasks. This application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); that is, the application is operated by typing commands into a Command Box.

## 4. Event Commands
This section contains the available commands to manage events in **SLAM**.

### 4.1 Add an Event

### 4.2 Select an Event
This allows you to select an event from your list using the eventâ€™s numerical position in the list (i.e. the eventâ€™s ID). Upon selection, more details about that event will be displayed, and you may perform additional commands with the selected event (e.g. adding tasks to complete).

**Format:** `select -e EVENT_ID`

**Example:** `select -e 1`
> ðŸ’¡ The `select` command is especially useful to keep in mind! An event needs to be selected before any changes to its tasks can be done.

**Expected Output:**
```
> select -e 1
```
```
Here are the details of the event:
Title: Tembusu Concert
Date: 19 Feb 2022 - 20:00
Description: Semesterly Arts Week Fundraiser
Venue: MPH
Budget: $1000.0
Tasks:
1. Make props
```

### 4.3 Mark an Event as `done`

### 4.4 Mark an Event as `undone`

### 4.5 Delete an Event
Deletes an event from the list.

**Format:** `delete -e EVENT_ID`

**Example:** `delete -e 1`

> ðŸš¨ If you choose to `delete` an event, all of its associated tasks will be deleted too.

**Expected Output:**
```
> delete -e 1
```
```
This event has been removed: Tembusu Concert
```

### 4.6 Find Event(s) based on keyword(s)

### 4.7 List all Events

### 4.8 Display next upcoming Event

### 4.9 Update an Event

### 4.10 Delete all Events
This allows you to delete all events.

> ðŸš¨ As this can potentially affect a huge amount of your data, the program will confirm with you again if you want to delete all events.

**Format:** `delete all`

After entering `delete all`, this is what you will see:

```
> delete all
```
```
Are you sure you want to delete all events? (Y/N)
> Y
I have deleted everything!
```
> ðŸš¨ Once you confirmed that you want to delete all events, the action is irreversible!
