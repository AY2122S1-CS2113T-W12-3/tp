# SLAM User Guide
Welcome to **SLAM**! **SLAM** is a desktop application for student group leaders in NUS to manage their group events, tasks, members and various activities. This application allows you to effectively plan and manage the organisation of events by allowing users to create and add such events to their schedule. Leading up to the actual date and time of the event, committee heads can add tasks (e.g. meetings, purchase of logistics) to complete under each event to keep track of progress. Group members can also be added and assigned to these tasks. This application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); that is, the application is operated by typing commands into a Command Box.

## 4. Event Commands
This section contains the available commands to manage events in **SLAM**.

### 4.1 Add an Event
Adds an event to your current catalog of events.

To add an event, first describe the event using the following command:

**Format:** `add -e n/TITLE d/DATE_&_TIME v/VENUE b/BUDGET`

**Example:** `add -e n/Temasek Hall Concert d/30-11-2021 2300 v/MPH b/500`

Following which, **SLAM** will prompt you for an optional description for your event which should look like this:

```
> add -e n/Temasek Hall Concert d/30-11-2021 2300 v/MPH b/500
```
```
Please add an optional description for your item and press enter.
```
```
>
```
Key in your description and press `enter`, or just press `enter` if you have none. You have successfully added an event into **SLAM**!

### 4.2 Select an Event
This allows you to select an event from your list using the eventâ€™s numerical position in the list (i.e. the eventâ€™s ID). Upon selection, more details about that event will be displayed, and you may perform additional commands with the selected event (e.g. adding tasks to complete).

**Format:** `select -e EVENT_ID`

**Example:** `select -e 1`
> ðŸ’¡ The `select` command is especially useful to keep in mind! An event needs to be selected before any changes to its tasks can be done.

**Expected Output:**
```
> select -e 1
```
```
Here are the details of the event:
Title: Tembusu Concert
Date: 19 Feb 2022 - 20:00
Description: Semesterly Arts Week Fundraiser
Venue: MPH
Budget: $1000.0
Tasks:
1. Make props
```

### 4.3 Mark an Event as `done`
This will allow you to mark an event as done after the event is over. 

**Format:** `done -e EVENT_ID`

**Example:** `done -e 1`

**Expected Output:**
```
> done -e 1
```
```
Nice! I have marked these items as done!
[E][X] Tembusu Concert (at: 19 Feb 2022 - 20:00)
--------LIST UPDATED--------
```

### 4.4 Mark an Event as `undone`
This will allow you to undo an event that was marked done if the event is not over yet.

**Format:** `undo -e EVENT_ID`

**Example:** `undo -e 1`

**Expected Output:**
```
Ok, I have unmarked these items:
[E][ ] Tembusu Concert (at: 19 Feb 2022 - 20:00)
--------LIST UPDATED--------
```

### 4.5 Delete an Event
Deletes an event from the list.

**Format:** `delete -e EVENT_ID`

**Example:** `delete -e 1`

> ðŸš¨ If you choose to `delete` an event, all of its associated tasks will be deleted too.

**Expected Output:**
```
> delete -e 1
```
```
This event has been removed: Tembusu Concert
```
### 4.6 Delete all Events
This allows you to delete all events.

> ðŸš¨ As this can potentially affect a huge amount of your data, the program will confirm with you again if you want to delete all events.

**Format:** `delete all`

After entering `delete all`, this is what you will see:

```
> delete all
```
```
Are you sure you want to delete all events? (Y/N)
> Y
I have deleted everything!
```
> ðŸš¨ Once you confirmed that you want to delete all events, the action is irreversible!

## 5. Task Commands
This section contains the available commands for managing tasks for events in **SLAM**. Because all tasks belong to a specific event in your catalog, an event must first be selected ([see Section 5.2 on Selecting Events](#52-select-an-event)) before any of the below commands can be used.

### 5.1 Add a task 
Note: For this current version of **SLAM**, pre-selecting an `Event` is not required for this command.

**Prerequisite:** You must have added at least one event and one member before adding a task.

Adds a task to an existing event in your current catalog of events.

To add a task, first describe the task using the following command:

**Format:** `add -t n/TITLE d/DATE_&_TIME`

**Example:** `add -t n/Buy stage lights d/10-11-2021 1600`

### 5.2 Mark a Task as `done`

## 8. FAQ

>**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 
>
>**A**: You can transfer your data to another computer by copying the `data` folder found in the directory where SLAM was used, and pasting it in the directory of the device where **SLAM** is intended to be run.

>**Q**: Can I delete all members from my current roster using `delete all`? 
> 
>**A**: The current verson of **SLAM** (2.0) does not allow for this. We are working on this on a future update for v2.1.

>**Q**: Will deleting a member from my roster remove that member from all tasks he/she is assigned to? 
>
>**A**: SLAM 2.0 does not support this functionality and we are working on a fix for this for our v2.1 update. Hang on tight in the meanwhile and ensure your members produce work for you before kicking them out! ðŸ˜‰
